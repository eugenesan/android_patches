Subject: [PATCH] PDroid 1.32 - The Better Privacy Protection

PDroid allows blocking access for any installed application to the following data separately:
    Device ID (IMEI/MEID/ESN)
    Subscriber ID (IMSI)
    SIM serial (ICCID)
    Phone and mailbox number
    Incoming call number
    Outgoing call number
    GPS location
    Network location
    List of accounts (including your google e-mail address)
    Account auth tokens
    Contacts
    Call logs
    Calendar
    SMS
    MMS
    Browser bookmarks and history
    System logs
    SIM info (operator, country)
    Network info (operator, country)

For device ID, phone and mailbox number, SIM serial, subscriber ID and device location it also allows supplying custom or random values.

Why you would want to use it:
    Applicaitons do NOT crash when access to private data is blocked (unlike with Permissions Denied or CM)
    Fine-grained tuning of access to private data
    No background service needed
    Very small memory footprint (~700KB)
    No impact on battery life
    No impact on performance (5ms overhead on access to private data; yes, that's 0.005s)
    100% reliable unlike ROOT applications (LBE), which need to start their background service on boot (see android underground to learn why this is an issue)
    No ROOT required for the app to run
    No Android permissions required for the app to run
    Open-source

Requires configuration application from here: http://goo.gl/DTg31
